**⚠️ CRITICAL DATAFLOW ANALYSIS REQUIRED:**

You have the COMPLETE attack path from source to sink. Use this to make an informed decision:

1. **Is the SOURCE actually attacker-controlled?**
   - HTTP parameter, user input, file upload → HIGH risk, attacker controls this
   - Configuration file, environment variable → MEDIUM risk, requires other access
   - Hardcoded constant, internal data → FALSE POSITIVE, not attacker-controlled

2. **Are any sanitizers in the path EFFECTIVE?**
   - For each sanitizer/validator step, determine if it actually prevents exploitation
   - Can an attacker bypass it with encoding, special characters, or edge cases?
   - Is it applied correctly to all code paths?

3. **Is the complete path EXPLOITABLE?**
   - Can you trace a realistic attack from source through all steps to sink?
   - What payload would bypass sanitizers and reach the sink with malicious content?

4. **What's the ACTUAL exploitability** considering the full dataflow path?

    prompt += """
**Your Task — work through each stage in sequence:**

**Stage A: One-shot verification**
Is the vulnerability pattern real? Does the code actually do what the scanner claims?
Attempt to confirm exploitability. If clearly a false positive, explain why.

**Stage B: Attack path analysis**
What is the attack path from attacker-controlled input to the vulnerable code?
What preconditions does an attacker need? Are those preconditions realistic?
What blocks exploitation? What enables it?
If you identify blockers, can they be bypassed?

**Stage C: Sanity check**
Does the code at the stated location match the finding description?
Is the source-to-sink flow real, or did the scanner fabricate a connection?
Is this code reachable from an entry point, or is it dead code?

**Stage D: Ruling**
Is this test code, example code, or documentation?
Does exploitation require another vulnerability as a prerequisite?
Does exploitation require the victim to perform an unlikely action?
If your reasoning hedges ("maybe", "in theory"), verify the claim or rule it out.

**Final assessment:**
Based on your analysis through Stages A-D:
- Rate exploitability_score from 0.0 (impossible) to 1.0 (trivial to exploit)
- Set confidence to high, medium, or low based on how certain you are
- Estimate CVSS score (0.0-10.0)
- Set is_true_positive based on whether the vulnerability pattern is real
- Set is_exploitable based on whether a realistic attack path exists
- Set ruling to exactly one of: validated, false_positive, unreachable, test_code, dead_code, mitigated
- Describe the attack scenario if exploitable
- Identify the CWE ID if applicable (e.g., CWE-79 for XSS, CWE-120 for buffer overflow)
- Identify the vuln_type category (e.g., command_injection, xss, buffer_overflow)
- Summarize the dataflow as a concise source->sink chain (e.g., "request.getParameter('id') -> Statement.executeQuery()")
- Provide remediation guidance: what should the developer do to fix this?
- If ruling is false_positive, set false_positive_reason to explain why

Be rigorous. False positives waste significant downstream effort (exploit generation,
patch creation, review). But do not dismiss real vulnerabilities — investigate first.

Your ruling, is_true_positive, and is_exploitable MUST be consistent with your reasoning.
Do not mark a finding as exploitable if your reasoning concludes it is safe or a false positive."""
